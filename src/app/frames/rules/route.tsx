            generate below a paragraph where you explain the game and the rules:
            - what is the game about
            - how to play
            - how to win
            - when the game ends
            - how to check the leaderboard
            - how to check the pool

            here there is a long description of the game:
            Milionario is a decentralized version of the game 1in1 Million where the user has to win 13 plays in a row to be the 1 in 1 million winner.
            The game is played with the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors, and it is played in a Farcaster frame and to win the user has to win 13 games in a row (draws are not counted as wins and will reset the user's streak).
            The game will end when a user wins 13 games in a row.
            To start playing the user has to pay a fee of 0.015 ETH Sepolia that will be added to the pool and he will be able to play 5 games.
            The user will get a reward every time he reaches 6, 9, and 13 wins in a row from the pool.
            The frame's leaderboard will show the top 3 players with the highest streaks and win rates.

            Generate a super short summery of these rules!
